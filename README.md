Ionic v1 todos app

This is my first attempt at using the Ionic framework.

This program is heavily based on the guide app that can be found here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/.

However I made some major changes, fixes, and improvements including:
- Fixed selecting projects to work as intended
- Added the ability to edit and delete tasks
- Added the ability to delete projects
- Added some aesthetic changes in color and animations
- Fixed adding projects to be standardized with add/edit tasks and made it work on mobile
- Plus other misc changes...

Follow the same guide to install Ionic v1 if you haven't already and then navigate into the folder where you've placed this code in a
command line and run "ionic serve" which will automatically open a browser with the program running.
